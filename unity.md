## Widnow Docking/Snapping (grid)
I like Mint 18/Cinnamon docking/snapping behavior (itself a clone of Windows 7 "Aero" snapping, which I liked a lot when I was still using Windows.)

From [Use Keyboard Shortcuts for Faster Aero Snapping](http://www.pcworld.com/article/184194/Use_Keyboard_Shortcuts_for_Faster_Aero_Snapping.html):
>Specifically, tap Windows-Left Arrow to "snap" any selected window to the left side of the screen. Naturally, tapping Windows-Right Arrow snaps the selected window to the right side. (This comes in especially handy if you use multiple monitors, as you can't drag a window to the right edge of your lefthand screen or the left edge of your righthand screen.)

>While we're on the subject, Windows-Up Arrow maximizes the selected window, while Windows-Down Arrow returns it to its previous location and size.

There's limited supported in Unity, though.  

The default keys are:
- \<Ctrl\>-\<Super\>\<left\> (snap left)
- \<Ctrl\>-\<Super\>\<right\> (snap right)

I've remapped them to <Super><left> and <Super><right> so it's more like Mint/Cinnamon.  Remapping is done using CompizConfig and the Grid plugin.

Sadly, I can't find a way to get the full Aero/Cinnamon behavior (cycling through dock positions on repeated keypresses.)
