## Widnow Docking/Snapping (grid)
I like Mint 18/Cinnamon docking/snapping behavior (itself a clone of [Windows 7 ("Aero") snapping](http://www.pcworld.com/article/184194/Use_Keyboard_Shortcuts_for_Faster_Aero_Snapping.html).. which I liked a lot when I was still using Windows.)

There's limited supported in Unity, though.  

The default keys are:
- \<Ctrl\>-\<Super\>\<left\> (snap left)
- \<Ctrl\>-\<Super\>\<right\> (snap right)

I've remapped them to <Super><left> and <Super><right> so it's more like Mint/Cinnamon.  Remapping is done using CompizConfig and the Grid plugin.

Sadly, I can't find a way to get the full Aero/Cinnamon behavior (cycling through dock positions on repeated keypresses.)
